DBMS as a service in a public cloud is a great idea. Since it is hosted in Microsoft's data center, we are able to specify how much computing power and memory we require. This would be harder if we were running on local as our own computers are limited in power. With cloud, under the hood, the operations are parallelized, and so the runtimes are optimized. One disadvantage is that DBMS cloud service relies on a good internet connection as this can affect the speed that we receive data. Another disadvantage is security. Should the data center be compromised, everyone using the service hosted at that data center would have their sensitive data exposed. On a local computer there are still security concerns but one security attack will not affect a lot of people. These are the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS as a service in a public cloud.
